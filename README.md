# Female labor participation in STEM areas in Ecuador
This repository provides an analysis of female labor participation in STEM areas for the New Dimensions program.

New Dimensions is a comprehensive business intelligence program for women from disadvantaged backgrounds in Ecuador. Our goal is to open pathways for Ecuadorian women in STEM through data education and employability skills. This analysis provides context and background for the need for the program.

The inaugural cohort included 55 women and received $25,000 in funding from the US Embassy in Ecuador in 2023. We are now seeking support for the upcoming second cohort scheduled to launch in 2025. Our goal is to secure funding for the next four cohorts (i.e. 2025 through 2028).
